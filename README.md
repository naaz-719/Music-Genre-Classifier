# Music-Genre-Classifier



# Overview
This project uses machine learning models—K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest—to classify music genres accurately based on audio features. A user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit enables users to upload music or input audio data for instant genre predictions. To enhance transparency, the project integrates LIME, providing clear explanations of why a specific genre is predicted. The system supports a wide range of popular music genres including Rock, Pop, Jazz, Hip-hop, Classical, Blues, Country, Disco, Metal, and Reggae.

The dataset used for training and evaluation is the GTZAN Music Genre Classification dataset, sourced from Kaggle.
