# Music-Genre-Classifier



# Overview
This project uses machine learning models—K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest—to classify music genres accurately based on audio features. A user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit enables users to upload music or input audio data for instant genre predictions. To enhance transparency, the project integrates LIME, providing clear explanations of why a specific genre is predicted. The system supports a wide range of popular music genres including Rock, Pop, Jazz, Hip-hop, Classical, Blues, Country, Disco, Metal, and Reggae.

The dataset used for training and evaluation is the GTZAN Music Genre Classification dataset, sourced from Kaggle.


# Key Features
Genre Classification Models: Uses K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest classifiers to identify music genres based on audio features.

User Input: Allows users to input audio features or upload music tracks for genre prediction.

Explainable AI with LIME: Integrates LIME to give clear, interpretable explanations of the model’s predictions, helping users understand why a genre was selected.

Multiple Genre Support: Covers popular music genres such as Rock, Pop, Jazz, Hip-hop, Classical, Blues, Country, Disco, Metal, and Reggae.

Robust Dataset: Trained on the GTZAN dataset, ensuring reliable and diverse music genre classification.
